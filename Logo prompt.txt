Here’s a detailed concept for your "ParkHere" logo based on your specifications:

---

### Logo Concept:

**Icon:**  
- Combine a **car silhouette** with a **map pin** shape.  
- The car shape forms the upper part of the pin, with the pin’s pointed bottom clearly visible.  
- The car is simplified and flat, no gradients or shadows, just clean lines.

**Colors:**  
- Use **Blue (#3498db)** for the car silhouette.  
- Use **Teal (#27ae60)** for the map pin outline or fill.  
- Use **Green (#2ecc71)** for accent details on the car (like windows or wheels).  
- Use **Orange (#ff9f43)** for a small highlight or dot inside the pin to add vibrancy.

**Text:**  
- "ParkHere" in a modern sans-serif font like **Montserrat**, **Poppins**, or **Lato**.  
- Color the text primarily in **Blue (#3498db)** for consistency and professionalism.  
- Optionally, highlight “Here” in **Teal (#27ae60)** or **Green (#2ecc71)** for subtle emphasis.

**Layout:**  
- Icon on the left, text on the right, horizontally aligned.  
- Balanced spacing, clean and minimal.

**Background:**  
- Transparent, so it can be placed on any surface.

### Example Description (for a designer or yourself):

1. **Icon Design:**  
   - Start with a map pin shape (teardrop).  
   - Inside the pin, place a simple car silhouette facing right.  
   - The car’s roofline and windows form the upper curve of the pin.  
   - Use Blue (#3498db) for the car body.  
   - Outline or fill the pin in Teal (#27ae60).  
   - Add small Green (#2ecc71) details on the car (like wheels or window highlights).  
   - Place a small Orange (#ff9f43) dot near the pin’s point to represent a location marker.

2. **Text:**  
   - Use Montserrat Bold or Semi-Bold.  
   - Write “ParkHere” with “Park” in Blue (#3498db) and “Here” in Teal (#27ae60) or Green (#2ecc71).  
   - Keep letter spacing tight but readable.

3. **Final Touch:**  
   - Ensure all elements are vector-based for scalability.  
   - Keep the design flat with no shadows or gradients.  
   - Export with transparent background in PNG and SVG formats.
